## 1. Introduction

The Infosys Springboard Internship is a structured learning program designed to provide exposure to emerging technologies and practical skills relevant to industry requirements. This internship emphasizes conceptual understanding, hands-on programming, and project-based learning. As part of this internship, interns are required to work on a project titled **“Crypto Volatility and Risk Analyzer.”** This repository documents the learning progress, conceptual understanding, and initial project work completed during the internship.

## 2. Internship Orientation

An orientation session was conducted to explain the objectives, structure, and expectations of the internship program. The mentor introduced the internship workflow, evaluation criteria, and the importance of teamwork and documentation. Participants also introduced themselves, which helped create a collaborative learning environment.

Following the orientation, interns were grouped into teams and assigned projects that would be developed throughout the internship.

## 3. Introduction to Cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual form of currency that uses cryptographic techniques to secure transactions and regulate the creation of new units. Unlike traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks and are not controlled by central authorities such as banks or governments. Transactions are transparent, secure, and recorded permanently on a public ledger.

Popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple were discussed to understand real-world applications and market relevance.

## 4. Blockchain Technology

Blockchain technology forms the backbone of cryptocurrency systems. It is a distributed and immutable digital ledger that records transactions in the form of blocks. Each block contains transaction data, a timestamp, and a cryptographic hash of the previous block, thereby forming a secure chain.

### Key Features of Blockchain Technology
- **Decentralization:** No single authority controls the network  
- **Transparency:** Transactions are visible to all participants  
- **Immutability:** Once recorded, data cannot be altered  
- **Security:** Cryptographic techniques ensure data integrity  

Blockchain technology enables trust, prevents fraud, and supports peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries.

## 5. Block Sharing

Block sharing refers to the process through which a newly validated block is broadcast to all nodes in a blockchain network. Once verification is completed, the block is shared across the network so that all participants update their copy of the ledger. This ensures data consistency, transparency, and synchronization among all nodes.

## 6. Crypto Volatility and Risk

Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, meaning that prices can fluctuate rapidly within short periods. Volatility represents the degree of price variation over time and serves as a key indicator of risk. High volatility implies higher uncertainty and greater potential for both profits and losses, whereas low volatility indicates relatively stable price movements.

## 7. Project Description

The **Crypto Volatility and Risk Analyzer** project aims to analyze historical cryptocurrency price data to measure volatility and assess risk levels using data analytics and statistical techniques. The system processes market data to identify price fluctuations and generate meaningful risk indicators. Visual representations such as charts and graphs will help users understand market instability and support informed decision-making.

## 8. Technologies Used

- **Python** – data analysis and computation  
- **Pandas and NumPy** – data processing  
- **Cryptocurrency APIs (CoinGecko / Binance)**  
- **Statistical Techniques** – standard deviation and return analysis  
- **Data Visualization Tools (Matplotlib / Plotly)**  
- **Web Technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)** – future scope

## 9. Objectives of the Project

1. Analyze historical cryptocurrency price data  
2. Measure volatility and risk levels  
3. Identify high-risk and low-risk cryptocurrencies  
4. Visualize price trends and market fluctuations  
5. Assist users in informed decision-making

## 10. Python Learning and Practice

Python programming was introduced with a focus on its applications in data analytics. Hands-on practice was conducted using Python IDEs and Google Colab. Basic concepts such as variables, data types, arithmetic operations, input/output, and string manipulation were practiced.

### Sample Code Practiced
```python
a = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print(a ** 0.5)
